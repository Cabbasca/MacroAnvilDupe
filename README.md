#  MacroAnvilDupe (MAD)
Well, since [Glorman](https://github.com/GGlorman/AnvilDupe) did a Anvil duper and called it a "Auto" Anvil Duper i decided to fork it and do a high ping version so yeah, if you are a high ping player on 1F2D and want to have a "Auto" duper here it is.\
\
I put quotes on his "Auto" thing cuz its more like a macro and not a smart bot, i don't judge him.\
Forked and modified by Visivel :3
## How it works?

`Clone and download the repository to your computer.`\
`Extract it wherever you want.`\
`Open a Command Prompt and put the directory to where you downloaded.`\
`Go to the directory and do py main.py on cmd`\
`In Minecraft open the Anvil Gui and click on the item that you wish to dupe.`\
`Press ] and it will rename it with a space.`\
`Press ] until the anvil breaks.`

## Configuring

`Go in main.py using Notepad or whatever compiler`
`Change delay to your config, i recommend 0.01 for low ping users, or 0.5 for ultra high ping`
`Change anvilslot1 for where you gonna place the item on the anvil`
`Change anvilslot2 for where it gonna be the output of the item (the renamed item)`
`Save changes and go to Command Prompt`
`Do cd [your directory of where you downloaded this] (example: cd c:\downloads\MacroAnvilDupe-main)`
`Then do py main.py (you will need Python installed for that, python.org)` 

## Dependencies and Installation for dummies

Since Glorman didn't told you about Dependencies here is it in case if the duper doesn't works:

You will need to install this stuff (using cmd) on where you downloaded the duper

```bash
  py -m pip install pyautogui
  py -m pip install pynput
```
Btw you will need Pip installed on your computer to execute it on your cmd
    
## Features!

- Slower duper adapted for ~250ms players
- Changed the keybind to ] instead of L


## Known bugs

- Screen size: 
You can change it at configs on main.py, i recommend using a software to view mouse coordinates
- Delay: 
You also can change that on configuration pretty easy.

Or ask to Glorman do that for you at his dm or requests.\
IM NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU SUPPORT, any issue ask Glorman.
